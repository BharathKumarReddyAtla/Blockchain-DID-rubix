RubiX chain is an aggregation of several account-chains existing in parallel. Transactions achieve consensus individually, allowing for asynchronous parallelism leading to very high scalability. Account-chains are linked through unique tokens & tokenchain hashes.
The Rubix Proofchain protocol is a deterministic state-machine that is designed to address the scale, cost, and privacy shortcomings of blockchain protocols that rely on one sequentially organized chain of all global transactions.
The protocol divides the global statemachine into a large, but finite number of state-machines called Proofchains.
While each Proofchain maintains one state, together all Proofchains represent a globally accessible singleton state that is immutable. 
This paper explains various components that make up the protocol.
The Rubix global state will be made of about 51.4 million Proofchains. Each Proofchain is bound by one unique utility token. A ProofChain PT is made of all transactions that use token Tn to confirm. All transactions within a Proofchain PT are validated individually and sequentially. However, transactions of different Proofchains are validated asynchronously and parallelly.
